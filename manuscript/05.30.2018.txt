#Starting the story voyage (almost 4 years in)

May 30, 2018

In a few months I'll be entering the fifth year of my writing experiment. 

What is this experiment?, you ask. 

There will be time enough later to go into detail, to tell a proper story. 

For now, though, just know that three days before my 27th birthday I quit my corporate job to make a writing life. 

Boy, was I na√Øve about many things then. My maturity was not what it could be. My skill in writing and craft far from what they would become even in a few years time.

Mainly, I set out to write fiction. Novels.

I've completed two novels. One is on submission to agents. 

The other I will be self-publishing very soon, in June 2018, in print and digital. 

This story voyage is ongoing. I intend to write my entire life. My personality is such that I must create to live. 

This journal, which might contain essays, poems, and even pontification, aims to be an outlet for creativity. Simply writing novels, sometimes, isn't enough for me. 

I don't know what you'll find in this journal, because it hasn't been written yet. 

Bon voyage!

(et allons travailler!)

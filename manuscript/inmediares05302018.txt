# In media res

My conscious experience occurs in media res. The moment is always now. Sure, my conscious experience may be slightly in the past, but there is always something that has happened before now, and it is always now.
 
This, shall we say brute fact, is an element of the structure we all live in as human beings. To explore consciousness, then, is to first notice these parameters, and then walk outside the walls wherever possible.
 
I like what Thomas Metzinger shared with Sam Harris on his podcast: you are either an explorer of conscious experience or you are not.

I explore conscious experience through fiction writing (2 novels so far) mindful exercise, through lucid dreaming (had 2 this month, very very interesting!).

How are you exploring conscious experience? How are you making yourself available to the unknown?

#Assisted Heaven or 1,000 years?

Story idea:

Family weighing end-of-life decision as science is on cusp of the next 40-year anti-aging technology and passing into VR land is also possible.

A third option, assisted death right now, is also on the table.

A family must settle old scores to make the right decision for their father.

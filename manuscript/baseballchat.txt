# Baseball Chat

Tonight I walked over to baseball game and met up with Scott, my good friend from college. He was generous enough to share his ticket with me, and we had good to our chat about life and business and what's next for us.

The most interesting parts of our discussion where about our relationships.

When we are out in public, we are able to focus on the people we are with, instead of the distractions that normally one would encounter when single.

Scott is already married, and I will be married in early 2019.

My concerns about making a commitment, earlier in my twenties, are gone. But even if they were not gone completely, it has become clear that the benefits and potential of making a commitment are far above the cost of limiting oneself to one relationship.

There is an element of unearned wisdom here. It is easy for me to claim this new-found insight and to share it with you. But I would not have been able to hear this as a 25 year old. I simply needed to go through the experience of worrying about commitment, and then progressing into this space of developing a relationship with a person and beginning to grow my imagination into the landscape of us, and what we could become together.

The attention now that I can spare in everyday interactions with people, also has shown benefits in my friendships. For example, I was able to notice Scott's interest and my book launch today. He clearly was excited and encouraging and wanted to know more about what I felt like. Here was an example of a friend empathizing and letting me explore my emotions. That was a really cool thing to experience.

I am hopeful that others will attend to their relationships and notice these signals when friends or even people who perhaps should not be their friends anymore give them the right or wrong signals.
